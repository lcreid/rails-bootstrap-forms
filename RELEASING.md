# Releasing

Follow these steps to release a new version of bootstrap_form to rubygems.org.

## Prerequisites

* You must have commit rights to the bootstrap_form repository.
* You must have push rights for the bootstrap_form gem on rubygems.org.
* You must be using a Ruby version that is not end-of-life.

## How to release

1. Determine which would be the correct next version number according to [semver](http://semver.org/).
2. Update the version in `./lib/bootstrap_form/version.rb`.
3. Make sure that you have all the gems necessary for testing and releasing.

       BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/7.2.gemfile bundle update

4. **Ensure the tests are passing by running the tests**

   (There should be no errors or warnings.)

       bundle exec rake test:all

   You will have failures in the system tests unless you're running on Linux. Chrome on each operating system renders slightly differently.

6. Update the GitHub diff links at the beginning of `CHANGELOG.md` (The pattern should be obvious when you look at them).
7. Update the installation instructions in `README.md` to use the new version.
8. Commit the CHANGELOG and version changes in a single commit; the message should be "Preparing vX.Y.Z" where `X.Y.Z` is the version being released.
9. Tag, push to GitHub, and publish to rubygems.org:

       bundle exec rake release

10. Go to https://github.com/bootstrap-ruby/bootstrap_form/releases and create the new release and add release notes by clicking the "Generate release notes" button.
    Add the link of closed issues from CHANGELOG.
    Group the commits in sections:
    * ### New features
    * ### Bugfixes
    * ### Performance
    * ### Documentation
    * ### Development
